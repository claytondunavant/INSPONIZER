# INSPONIZER

   INSPONIZER's goal is to empower style enthusiasts to better organize and share their digital photos of inspirational outfits by allowing documentation on the digital photo file of the names and brands of the articles of clothing in each outfit.

   Basically, INSPONIZER allows the names and brands of articles of clothing to be stored in photos of inspirational outfits. This enables style enthusiasts to better organize their photos due to the fact they now more readily have the information on the pieces in the outfit. Additionally, INSPONIZER allows for easier sharing of the whole outfit. If one user sends their outfit to another user, the other user will readily have the information on what the latter user was wearing in that photo.
